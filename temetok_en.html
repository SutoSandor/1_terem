  <h1>The medieval cemeteries</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
  In addition to the Árpád-era graves of Babat settlement, we know the cemetery situated around the medieval church of Gödöllő - that was once standing in the place of the castle.  The burial place next to the church, that was already existing in the 15th century, could be used until the 1730s, the beginning of the construction works of Count Antal Grassalkovich. With the construction of the castle the cemetery was liquidated, Grassalkovich designated a new cemetery outside the village. This is a part of today's Protestant Cemetery (Dózsa György út). The graves outside the construction site were not disturbed, what we know from the fact that in 1967, during the laying of water pipes, more graves were cut across by the workers. The findings included children's graves from the time of the Turkish occupation. A deceased girl's face and headdress reconstruction can be seen at the exhibition.
