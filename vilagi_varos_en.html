  <h1>Gödöllő, the baroque market town</h1><br>
  <p id="szoveg">
    Gödöllő, as the representative estate center of Antal Grassalkovich I. became an urban settlement in the second half of the 18th century. The image that was created then remained dominant until the 1970s, when during the large-scale building of housing estates and public buildings, most of the historical city center was demolished - except for a few buildings.<br><br>
    The population growth in the 18th century was accompanied by the expansion of the village street network. The count had the trees of the Haraszti forest  cut down in an area between the roads to Pest (now Highway 30) and Vác (today Dózsa György road). Here he placed the market grounds (now Szabadság Square), and opened new streets for the settlers. He had 100 new house built for the settlers in German style, but he helped the old Protestant residents too to build new houses for themselves.<br><br>
    In the outermost street (today Körösfői-Kriesch Aladár street) there were only a few farm buildings. The new cemetery, on the area assigned by the landlord, fell outside of the inhabited area.<br><br>
    In several places stone bridges arched over the Rákos stream, built by the estate, in the outskirts of the village there were important economic buildings (press house, mills, a sheepcote that could accommodate 1,000 animals). The first public sculptures were erected in our town (Mary's column, the statue of St. John of Nepomuk) and fountains were built as well. <br>
