  <h1>The history of Gödöllő's coat of arms</h1><br>
  <p id="szoveg">
    Gödöllő's first known seal was supposedly made at the end of the 17th century. Then the settlement appeared in the written sources as a curial village. Already on this seal there is the representation of the pelican, tearing out its breast feathers and feeding its nestlings with its own blood. The seal was in use until 1767.<br><br>
    The representations of the pelican in the 16-17th century were closely related to Protestantism, so it could be the Protestant population - settling back to Gödöllő in 1649 after the depopulation during the fifteen-year war -who brought it here.<br><br>
    Since the village received market town status (1763), the seal had to be replaced also, its circumscription is affixed with the new status: "Sigillum: oppidi: GEDELLEÖ. 1768 ". On the picture part bordered by the circumscription, on a stylized rondache there is a pelican turned right, tearing its breast, feeding its nestlings with its own blood. On the top of the shield there is a  frog-mouth helm with three feathers, the shield is covered with a Baroque helmet holder. This seal was used by the municipality of the town for nearly a hundred years. Its construction was the birth of our city's first arms.<br><br>
    In 1861 three new seals were made, with Hungarian inscriptions. The pelican, as a coat of arms animal remained. The seal labeled "GÖDÖLLŐ M V" became the first rubber stamp of the settlement. Next to it there was a separate notary seal as well. These seals had to be replaced because of the municipal law, but they were used later too.<br><br>
    From the second half of the 19th century, we know the heraldically more advanced version and the colors of the arms as well: a standing rectangular shaped Modern French shield, in its blue field, on the top of a conical hill there is a silver colored pelican in its nest, with its neck bent right, wings extended, feeding its nestlings with its blood from its breast. On the chief there are two blue, six-pointed stars on a horizontal silver field. On the shield there is a helmet, on it there is an octagonal gold pearl crown with three red gems on its hoop, above it there is the pelican just as on the shield. On its top and both sides there are baroque style silver-blue lambrequins.  <br><br>
    In the second half of the 20th century, the coat of arms degraded, simplified, only the pelican was kept. Gödöllő City Council in 1974, for the 30th anniversary of the city's liberation ordered a coat of arms, which was designed meeting the socialist requirements , even recorded in a Council Regulation: standing shield, on the right side dark green, the left red. In its middle a radiant golden sun, at the top on a red field a five-pointed red star in gold frame, on the green field a golden cog wheel. In the middle and lower third a silver pelican with extended wings, feeding its three nestlings.<br><br>
    The pelican is not any more a symbol related to self-sacrifice and light. "The pelican feeding its nestlings is the motif of Gödöllő market town's  coat of arms. It points out that the town, also as a district center selflessly shares its intellectual, industrial and agricultural goods, at the same time it symbolizes the sacrifice, helpfulness and togetherness. "( Except from the 1974 No.4. Council Regulation)<br><br>
    After the End of Communism our coat of arms renewed again. The city's actual coat of arms representation is: on a Modern French shield, on a blue field there is a silver pelican sitting on its silver nest, with extended wings, feeding its three nestlings with its blood from its breast. The shield is topped with a light gray facing helmet, with dark red lining. On the helmet there is a leafy, beaded rank crown with green and red jewels, from which three golden ears of wheat grow out, surrounded by leaves. The lambrequin is on the right side blue and silver, on the left red and silver.<br><br>
