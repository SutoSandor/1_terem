  <h1>Relics from the age of the House of Árpád kings</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
  The village of Babat from the age of the Árpád dynasty was located on the outskirts of Gödöllő, northeast of the town.<br><br>
  The traces of the village are from earlier than Gödöllő, 10th-11th century pottery pieces were found here. Its small, towerless church looking NE-SW was 9.8m long, 6-6.3m wide and it was built from sandstone - according to the 1991 excavation. Sandstone is sedimentary rock, consisting of grains of 0.06 - 2.0 mm particle size, which are bound together by binding agent. It is characterized by the fact that the components can be distinguished with the naked eye. Significant components: quartz, feldspar, mica and calcite.
  <br><br>
  The inhabitants of the village were buried around the church. Babat was depopulated at the beginning of the late Middle-Ages at the latest.<br><br>
  The animation of the digital reconstruction of the Babat church can be seen on the digital photo frame. <br><br>
  <br><b>Medieval Gödöllő</b><br><br>
 The medieval village of Besenyő was established on the eastern edge of today's town. It was first mentioned in writing in 1345 when King Louis I donated it to Ivan Nelepcs. Over the next 200 years, the name of the settlement was mentioned several times in certificates and boundary documents. It was finally destroyed during the 15-year war at the end of the 16th century. In the early 2000s archaeologists discovered a lot of archaeological findings indicative of the life of the former village (clay pots, stove eyes and stove tiles, ironware) in the northern part of the site, during the construction of the residential area of Incső.<br><br>
 The medieval predecessor of today's settlement can be found in and around the current city centre, its exact extent is not known because of the coverage of the built-up area. The archaeological findings indicate that there were inhabitants in the settlement already in the 12th and 13th centuries. The first certain, written mention, however, dates back to 1349 only when King Louis I donated the estate called Szada and Gödöllő (Gudulleu) of Tamas, son of Péter Zada, who had died without an heir, to Peter Poharus, the lord-lieutenant of Abaúj county. When the Poharus family became extinct, King Sigismund donated Gödöllő to his second wife Borbála Cillei in 1424 and became the property of the Rozgonyi family after her death. The medieval church of Gödöllő, mentioned by a source from 1492, was dismantled during the construction of the Grassalkovich palace, and today's palace chapel was built in its place. The tombs of the churchyard around the church were tampered with in 1967 when a plumbing duct was dug. According to the beaded aigrettes found in the tombs, the burials had occurred in the 16th-17th century.
