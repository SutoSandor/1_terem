  <h1>Gödöllő in the Migration Period</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
  <b>Sarmatians</b><br><br>

  In the first century after Christ the Iranian origin, equestrian nomad Sarmatian population coming from the northern shores of the Black Sea settled in and around Gödöllő. Their presence is traceable until the beginning of the fifth century. As the neighbors of Roman Empire's Pannonia province, that was defended by a limes,  the Sarmatians either launched a campaign against the province or were trading with its inhabitants. After settling down they built large villages. One of these villages was on the northwestern part of our city (the site of shopping centers), and was inhabited from the end of the 2nd century until the end of the 4th century.
  <br><br>
  Their houses were regular square or rectangular shaped semi-subterranean houses, on the opposing walls there were places for the wooden piles that were holding the saddle roof. Around them there were storage pits, garbage pits, borrow pits and outdoor ovens for baking and smoking. The typical Sarmatian smoking pits were about  1 meter apart from each other, connected by 35 cm wide underground vents. Under the oven's puddled bottom, sometimes as an extra heat-retaining layer flat stones were placed. Ditches of various functions (drainage, fences) split up the settlement. Archaeologists found skeletons in a pit and buried in a house, with pottery inclusion.
  <br><br>
  Next to a significant number of terra sigillata fragments (Roman luxury vessels) every day use gray homemade ceramic bowls, jugs, pots and containers were also found. In these large jars and barns both grains and fluids could be kept. They were particularly fond of smooth surface pottery. There are many hand-made pots and mugs which were produced locally by each colony. The typical vessels of the neighboring Germans (Quads), often with graphite finish were also mixed into the Sarmatian finds, indicating the composition of the population. The accessories of home industry, spindle buttons used for spinning and weaving, sharpening stones and knives were also found in the pits of the colonies.  From the garbage pits the consumed animals' bone remnants - horses, cattle, dogs - came to light.
  <br><br>
  On the colonies jewelry were rarely seen. In contrast to the tomb inclusions there were only lost, accidentally abandoned jewelry, clothes pins and belt buckles at a colony excavation. The small tin pendant and torque fragment were found during the excavation before the building of the TESCO, the iron buckles and brooches were unearthed at the place of a Lidl store. Sarmatian graves were found only sporadically in Gödöllő,  during construction works.
  <br><br>
  The Csörsz-trench, the huge ancient defense system is linked to the Romans and the Sarmatian population.
  <br><br>
  <br><b>Avars</b><br><br>
  The Avars appeared in the Carpathian Basin in 576, and forced the whole area under their rule.
  <br><br>
  The appearance of the stirrup in Europe is connected to the Avars, it allowed freedom of movement, standing up, turning back and efficient hand combat in the saddle. The use of the stirrup and the bow ensured their military superiority for a long time. Their weaponry consisted of lances, long, straight, single or double-edged swords, bows, arrows and quivers. At the end of the 7th century sabers also appeared.
  <br><br>
  Significant graves were found at the settlements around Gödöllő (Veresegyház, Kerepes, Dány, Zsámbok). Besides the graves traces of villages, houses, ovens were unearthed as well. The findings show that the most significant Avar village was on the border of Veresegyház and Szentjakab. In Gödöllő however, there are only graves from this period, no settlement has been found yet. It is assumed that the reason for this may be that in the Avar period Gödöllő was dominated by extensive forests, and the population of the neighboring villages buried their dead on clearings, or the traces of the settlement are hidden somewhere beneath our city.
  <br><br>
  The largest burial finds are the ten, late Avar graves found next to the forestry workshop (70 Szabadság Road). From this area a rectangular bone needle holder, pottery, a pressed bronze plate belt mounting, and an iron knife were unearthed over the years.
  <br><br>
  By the late Avar period the area between the Danube Bend and Gödöllő was densely populated. By the beginning of the 9th century the population was engaged in international trade, they lived well off. Their period came to an end because of the Frank- Avar wars and inner fights. After 829 only a few artifacts bear witness to the Avars, written sources do not even mention them. This is already the period of the Slavic expansion.
  <br><br>
  The conquerors found a population of mixed cultures here, Avar and Slavic characteristics both appeared in their costumes. However, their tracks in Pest county area are still not known.
