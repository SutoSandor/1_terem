  <h1>The Statue of St. John of Nepomuk </h1><br>
  <p id="szoveg">
    Today, the statue of St. John of Nepomuk is in front of the castle church. For the introduction of the saint's cult, at the request of the patron Antal Grassalkovich I, the patron saint of the castle chapel is St John Nepomuk, whose image also appears on the altar-piece.
    <br><br>
    The statue is standing on a pedestal surrounded by an iron grate. It depicts the saint in a priestly dress, with mitre on his head, holding a crucifix, standing above the altar table held by volutes. Next to the main figure on both sides of the altar table, there is a little angel figurine holding a cornucopia. The pedestal, the statue and the side figures are all made of stone. The statue of St. John of Nepomuk originally stood outside of the town, along the highway (Besnyő road, now Szabadság Road), next to the stone bridge of the Rákos stream. The statue was erected by Antal Grassalkovich I. in 1750. The artist is unknown. Its blessing took place in March, in the presence of the Bishop of Vác. Originally it was surrounded by an iron fence, which was later replaced by a stone fence. The statue stood in this place in the late 19th century. Then it was moved to a vacant land, then to its present location, the area in front of the chapel. Among the reasons for the relocation were the opening of the Szt. János Street (today János Street)  and the widening of the main road. The statue was renovated several times, but at the end of the 1980s it got degraded again. Then it was transported to be restored, it got back in front of the chapel in the summer of 1996. Its most recent restoration and rededication took place in the spring of 2016.
