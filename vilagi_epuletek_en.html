  <h1>The baroque buildings in Gödöllő</h1><br><br>
  <p id="szoveg">
    <b>The manor inn (Hamvay mansion)</b><br><br>
    About the inn built in the 1760s a long time local tradition said that it was built by one of Gödöllő's former landlord, Ferenc Hamvay, around 1662. Hence the name Hamvay mansion. Researches done in the late 20th century however proved that with the exception of the cellar the whole building is from the era of Grassalkovich.<br><br>
    Important income came from the operation of the inn, it was also the first apartment of the castle's grenadier hajdús (freelance soldiers).  Today's "movie-wing" site was originally the stables. In the mid-19th century the kitchen, the restaurant, the larder and the tenants' flat were on the ground floor. In addition to the basement an ice house belonged to the building too. The nine rooms  of the first floor were heated by stoves standing in stove alcoves. <br><br>
    After the Compromise (1867), when the Gödöllő estate became crown estate, after renovation the inn got the Erzsébet Királyné Szálló (Queen Elisabeth Hotel) name, and it was run by tenants. After 1916 the town itself rented the building, which served educational purposes for decades. The movie theater was built in 1939, with the projectionist apartments. From 1978 gradually the Local History Collection (now Gödöllő Town Museum) took possession of the building.<br><br><br>



    <b>The captain's apartment (Bodyguard Barracks)</b><br><br>
    The originally single-story building was one of the estate office buildings built in parallel with the castle. In the early 19th century, the house served as the apartment of the hajdús (freelance soldiers). The first floor was added after 1813. The wooden porch completing the facade facing the castle was made in the royal period (after 1867). At this time it served as the captain's apartment, and initially Franz Joseph and Queen Elizabeth's secretary's office. After 1920, under Governor Miklós Horthy, the building was used as  office premises and officer apartments.<br><br>
    Later the institution served cultural and other purposes, for a long time the editorial office of the Pest Megyei Hírlap (Pest County News) was here as well.<br>
    Since 2010, it is municipal property.<br><br><br>
     
   <b style="position: relative; left: -30px;">Press House</b><br><br>
    The press house was built around 1760 by Antal Grassalkovich I. It kept its importance until the phylloxera epidemic at the end of the 19th century. The building belonging to the estate was often the scene of entertainments as well.<br><br>
    In the second half of the 20th century it held various economic functions, its condition gradually worsened. It is currently in private ownership.<br><br><br>

   <b>Baroque house</b><br><br>
    The still standing baroque-facade house no longer belonged to the estate office and apartment buildings in 1813. Besides the captain's apartment this is the only remaining 18th-century building of the former row of houses facing the highway (2 Szabadság Square).<br><br><br>

   <b>The "Green House"</b><br><br>

    The "Green House" stood in the Fácános garden belonging to the lower garden of the castle. The building was built by Antal Grassalkovich I,and it was very similar in form to what we know today as Királydomb pavilion. The polygonal white building stood in a small clearing. The windows were covered with green shutters. The small house had a room with a fireplace, a kitchen and a larder. The count placed great emphasis on the view. As many corners the cottage had, the same amount of paths led from the clearing surrounding the little house to the woods. Through the slits of these paths there were stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The building functioned as a hunting lodge and resting place, but since it was close to the castle, it was rarely used. Later, when the royal family took possession of the land, the building became more important. One of the favorite places of Queen Elizabeth was the Fácános forest. She loved to walk among the hundred-year-old trees, and when she got tired while walking she often rested in the hunting lodge in one of the clearings of the forest. The house and the Fácános was a fenced and forbidden place. After the Queen's death, the building started to deteriorate, no one cared about its condition. In the first decades of the 20th century the Fácános and the small building became a popular place of the young people on holiday. The furniture was already very poor then, in addition to the white marble fireplace there was only an armchair and a bronze candlestick on the mantelpiece in the building.  <br><br>
    The building was continuously decaying. Over the years, the shutters and the glass door were stolen, the furnishings were gone, the artfully shaped fireplace was broken. During the time of the Hungarian Soviet Republic the Fácános forest was almost totally destroyed, the wildlife exterminated. The building became the home of vagabonds. Its roof structure was damaged by the storm, and the walls began to collapse as well. <br><br>
    In 1934 at the place of the building only a ground mound and some bricks were the reminders of the former hunting lodge. Together with the hunting lodge the surrounding forest was almost gone too.<br><br>
    The most valuable piece of the hunting lodge, the broken marble fireplace, was temporarily saved by the Premonstratensian order. The order had the object, as an interesting piece of local history, walled into  the hall of the boarding school. Above, in a semicircular niche they placed a picture of the Green House by László Fejéregyházi  art teacher. Under this they put the poem of Reming Bodnár Premonstratensian canon, that revived the history of the fireplace. The fireplace rescued from the hunting lodge thus ended up in a worthy environment. But it could not stay for long in this place, because after the socialization of the school the fireplace was gone. <br><br>
